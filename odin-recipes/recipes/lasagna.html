    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna, famed worldwide, has ancient origins and remains an Italian
      superstar dish. Basically, lasagna is a baked casserole made with wide
      flat pasta and layered with fillings such as ragú, bechamel, vegetables
      and various cheeses. Unsurprisingly, every Italian region has its own
      traditional recipe.

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and
        stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in ground turkey;
        cook until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir enchilada sauce and diced tomatoes into the pot. Simmer until
        flavors combine, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Mix cottage cheese, egg, and cumin together in a small bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Spread 1/3 of the turkey sauce in the bottom of an 8-inch baking dish.
        Cover with 1/2 of the corn tortillas. Spread 1/2 of the cottage cheese
        mixture on top. Sprinkle 1/3 of the Mexican cheese on top. Repeat layers
        once more, ending with remaining turkey sauce and Mexican cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spray a large piece of aluminum foil with cooking spray; cover the
        baking dish with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes. Remove
        aluminum foil and continue baking until top is browned, about 15
        minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving. Garnish with green onion.
